# pytest
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

# From Julia
```
from selenium import webdriver

Make sure that you provide the full path to the Chrome WebDriver executable file, not just the directory where it's located.


chrome_driver_path = "C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe"
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)
```
